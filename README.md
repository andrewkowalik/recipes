# Andrew's Recipes

The purpose of the repo is to document and adjust recipes that I enjoy cooking. I found myself often cooking recipes and making ad hoc adjustments that I never documented, only to finding my self relearning the recipe later on again.

I use the following [template](template.md) to document all recipes.

Enjoy!
